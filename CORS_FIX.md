# CORS Issue Resolution

## Problem Description

When trying to access the VAPT Dashboard frontend, users encountered the following CORS error:

```
Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'http://127.0.0.1:8001/api/dashboard-stats/' 
from origin 'http://localhost:5174' has been blocked by CORS policy: 
No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
```

## Root Cause

The Django backend CORS configuration was only allowing requests from `localhost:3000`, but the React frontend (built with Vite) was running on different ports (5173, 5174, 5175, etc.).

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated CORS Settings in Django

**File**: `backend/vapt_dashboard/settings.py`

**Before**:
```python
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS = [
    "http://localhost:3000",
    "http://127.0.0.1:3000",
]
```

**After**:
```python
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS = [
    "http://localhost:3000",
    "http://127.0.0.1:3000",
    "http://localhost:5173",
    "http://127.0.0.1:5173",
    "http://localhost:5174",
    "http://127.0.0.1:5174",
    "http://localhost:5175",
    "http://127.0.0.1:5175",
]

# Allow CORS for all localhost origins in development
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGIN_REGEXES = [
    r"^http://localhost:\d+$",
    r"^http://127\.0\.0\.1:\d+$",
]
```

### 2. Benefits of the Regex Configuration

The `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGIN_REGEXES` setting allows any localhost port, making development more flexible:
- ✅ Works with any Vite dev server port
- ✅ No need to update settings when port changes
- ✅ Supports both `localhost` and `127.0.0.1`

### 3. Backend Restart Required

After updating CORS settings, the Django development server needed to be restarted for changes to take effect.

## Verification

The fix was verified by testing the API with CORS headers:

```bash
curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:8001/api/dashboard-stats/ \
  -H "Origin: http://localhost:5174" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" -v
```

**Expected Response Headers**:
- `access-control-allow-origin: http://localhost:5174`
- `access-control-allow-credentials: true`

## Current Status

✅ **RESOLVED**: CORS issue has been fixed
✅ **Backend**: Running on http://127.0.0.1:8001
✅ **Frontend**: Running on http://localhost:5175 (or as shown in terminal)
✅ **API Communication**: Working properly
✅ **File Uploads**: Should now work without CORS errors

## Understanding CORS

**CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)** is a security feature implemented by web browsers that blocks web pages from making requests to a different domain, protocol, or port than the one serving the web page, unless the server explicitly allows it.

### Why This Happened

1. **Frontend Origin**: `http://localhost:5174`
2. **Backend Origin**: `http://127.0.0.1:8001`
3. **Different Origins**: Different host (localhost vs 127.0.0.1) and different ports (5174 vs 8001)
4. **Browser Blocked**: Without proper CORS headers, browser blocks the request

### How the Fix Works

1. **Server Headers**: Django now sends `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` headers
2. **Allowed Origins**: Backend explicitly allows requests from frontend origins
3. **Preflight Requests**: Browser can now successfully complete OPTIONS requests
4. **Credentials**: `CORS_ALLOW_CREDENTIALS = True` allows cookies and auth headers

## Development vs Production

### Development Configuration (Current)
- Allows all localhost ports via regex
- Credentials allowed
- Suitable for development only

### Production Recommendations
- Specify exact frontend domain (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com`)
- Remove regex patterns
- Use HTTPS origins only
- Consider more restrictive CORS policies

## Future Considerations

For production deployment:

```python
# Production CORS settings
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS = [
    "https://your-production-domain.com",
]

# Remove regex patterns in production
# CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGIN_REGEXES = []  # Remove this line
```

This fix ensures the VAPT Dashboard frontend can successfully communicate with the Django backend API without CORS restrictions in the development environment.
