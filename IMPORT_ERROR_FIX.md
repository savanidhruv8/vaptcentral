# Import Error Fix Summary

## ‚úÖ **Issue Resolved: Import Error**

### **Problem**
The frontend was showing this error:
```
Uncaught SyntaxError: The requested module '/src/services/api.js' does not provide an export named 'api'
```

### **Root Cause**
Several React components were trying to import `api` as a named export:
```javascript
import { api } from '../services/api';  // ‚ùå Wrong
```

But the `api.js` file exports `api` as a default export:
```javascript
export default api;  // ‚úÖ Correct
```

### **Files Fixed**

| File | Fixed Import |
|------|-------------|
| `AuthContext.jsx` | `import api from '../services/api'` |
| `Login.jsx` | `import api from '../../services/api'` |
| `AccountActivation.jsx` | `import api from '../../services/api'` |
| `UserManagement.jsx` | `import api from '../../services/api'` |

### **Correct Import Pattern**
```javascript
// ‚úÖ Correct way to import the api instance
import api from '../services/api';

// ‚úÖ Also correct for importing both api and named exports
import api, { getDashboardStats, resetDataset } from '../services/api';
```

## üöÄ **Status: Fixed**

All import errors have been resolved. The frontend should now load without any import errors.

## üß™ **Next Steps**

1. **Refresh the browser** at http://localhost:5173
2. **Check browser console** - no more import errors
3. **Test email links** - activation and password reset should work
4. **Test user management** - create users and test activation flow

## üìß **Email Links Should Now Work**

- **Activation**: http://localhost:5173/activate/{token}/
- **Login**: http://localhost:5173/login
- **Password Reset**: Available in login page

The import error was preventing the React components from loading properly. Now that it's fixed, all the email functionality should work correctly! üéâ
