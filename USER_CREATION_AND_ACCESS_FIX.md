# User Creation and Access Control Fixes

## ✅ **Issues Resolved**

### **1. User Creation 400 Bad Request Error**

#### **Problem**
When creating users, the frontend was getting a 400 Bad Request error because the `UserCreateSerializer` required a password field, but the frontend wasn't sending it.

#### **Root Cause**
```python
# Before (causing 400 error)
password = serializers.CharField(write_only=True, validators=[validate_password])
```

#### **Solution**
Modified `UserCreateSerializer` to make password optional and auto-generate a temporary password:

```python
# After (working correctly)
password = serializers.CharField(write_only=True, required=False, validators=[validate_password])

def create(self, validated_data):
    # If no password is provided, generate a temporary one
    if 'password' not in validated_data:
        validated_data['password'] = CustomUser.objects.make_random_password()
    
    user = CustomUser.objects.create_user(**validated_data)
    user.activation_token_expires = timezone.now() + timezone.timedelta(hours=24)
    user.save()
    return user
```

#### **How It Works**
1. Super admin creates user without password
2. Backend generates temporary password
3. User receives activation email
4. User sets their own password during activation

### **2. Role-Based Access Control for Data Reset**

#### **Problem**
The `reset_dataset` endpoint was accessible to all authenticated users, but only admin and super admin should be able to reset data.

#### **Solution**
Added role-based access control to the `reset_dataset` view:

```python
@api_view(['POST'])
@permission_classes([permissions.IsAuthenticated])
def reset_dataset(request):
    # Check if user is admin or super admin
    if not request.user.is_admin():
        return Response({
            'error': 'Only admin and super admin users can reset data'
        }, status=status.HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN)
    
    # ... rest of the function
```

### **3. Role-Based Access Control for File Upload**

#### **Problem**
The `ExcelUploadViewSet` didn't have proper role-based access control, allowing general users to upload files.

#### **Solution**
Added role-based access control to `ExcelUploadViewSet`:

```python
class ExcelUploadViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    permission_classes = [permissions.IsAuthenticated]
    
    def get_queryset(self):
        # Only admin and super admin users can upload files
        if not self.request.user.can_upload():
            return ExcelUpload.objects.none()
        return ExcelUpload.objects.all().order_by('-uploaded_at')
    
    def create(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
        # Check if user can upload
        if not request.user.can_upload():
            return Response({
                'error': 'Only admin and super admin users can upload files'
            }, status=status.HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN)
        
        # ... rest of the method
```

## 🔐 **Access Control Summary**

1. Login as super admin (`csu.aiml@gmail.com`)
2. Go to User Management
3. Click "Create User"
4. Fill in user details (no password needed)
5. Submit - should work without 400 error
6. Check email for activation link

### **Test Access Control**
1. **As Super Admin**: Should have full access to all features
2. **As Admin**: Should be able to upload files and reset data, but not manage users
3. **As General User**: Should only be able to view dashboard, not upload or reset

### **Test File Upload Access**
1. Login as general user
2. Try to upload a file
3. Should get 403 Forbidden error
4. Login as admin/super admin
5. Should be able to upload files

### **Test Data Reset Access**
1. Login as general user
2. Try to reset data
3. Should get 403 Forbidden error
4. Login as admin/super admin
5. Should be able to reset data

## 🚀 **Status: Fixed**

All issues have been resolved:
- ✅ User creation works without 400 error
- ✅ Role-based access control implemented
- ✅ Only admin/super admin can upload files
- ✅ Only admin/super admin can reset data
- ✅ Only super admin can manage users

The system now properly enforces role-based access control across all features! 🎉
